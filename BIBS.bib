abstract = {We suggest a unified approach to claims reserving for life insurance policies with reserve-dependent payments driven by multi-state Markov chains. The associated prospective reserve is formulated as a recursive utility function using the framework of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE). We show that the prospective reserve satisfies a nonlinear Thiele equation for Markovian BSDEs when the driver is a deterministic function of the reserve and the underlying Markov chain. Aggregation of prospective reserves for large and homogeneous insurance portfolios is considered through mean-field approximations. We show that the corresponding prospective reserve satisfies a BSDE of mean-field type and derive the associated nonlinear Thiele equation.

abstract = {The problem of the valuation of life insurance payments with policyholder behavior is studied. First, a simple survival model is considered, and it is shown how cash flows without policyholder behavior can be modified to include surrender and free policy behavior by calculation of simple integrals. In the second part, a more general disability model with recovery is studied. Here, cash flows are determined by solving a modified Kolmogorov forward differential equation. We conclude the paper with numerical examples illustrating the methods proposed and the impact of policyholder behavior.},

abstract = {The multi-state life insurance contract is reconsidered in a framework of securitization where insurance claims may be priced by the principle of no arbitrage. This way a generalized version of Thiele's differential equation is obtained for insurance contracts linked to indices, possibly marketed securities. The equation is exemplified by a traditional policy, a simple unit-linked policy and a half-dependent unit-linked policy.},

abstract = {The issue of bonus in life insurance is considered in a model framework where the traditional set-up is extended by letting the experience basis (mortality, interest, etc.) be stochastic. A novel definition of the technical surplus on an insurance contract is proposed, and basic principles for its repayment as bonus are discussed. Making the experience basis an endogenous part of the model opens possibilities of model-based prognostication of future bonuses. Numerical illustrations are provided.},
